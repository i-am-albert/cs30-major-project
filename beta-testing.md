# Beta Testing
## Programmer's advice:

advice: i would add something that stops the planet icons from overlapping each other, its hard to tell how far away you are when 2 or more icons overlap, maybe adjust the weight of cargo pieces a small bit, it feels a bit to hard get off the earth with no thrusters
bug: sometimes when taking cargo to the moon the new thruster will launch itself away and can knock other parts off of your ship

## Non-programmer's advice:

- the phycics are weird
- planets are too far away
- no sun
- planets are too small

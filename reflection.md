# Reflection
## What advice would I give myself?
- Complete more of the project early on, would allow for some cool ideas to be done
## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Yes, all was completed in the needs to have, which includes:
- Game's physics, gravity, planets, moon, sun, and modules with weight, energy, and thrust
## The hardest part?
- Determining when modules shouldn't be able to connect
- Making the modules not too buggy
## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- Some bugginess when attaching modules, or when modules are inside some modules without being attached
